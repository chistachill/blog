## My last week

I'm glad you decided to read my first post.My last week was incredible and interesting, because at Friday was my birthday. 

For the first few days of studying, I did all my university work for the whole week.On the night of Thursday to Friday, my friends has came to ,y flat and congratulate me. They came with air balloons, flowers and a little cake! The next day, on Saturday, with my friends from different periods of my life lmao we went to my birthday breakfast in a beautiful light restaurant, where we ate a lot of tasty organic food and celebrated. It was amazing birthday :)
